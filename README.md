A Multiuser Chatapp using Client-Server Architecture

This project is expected to be run in any Java Runtime Environment.  
## Step-1  
Run Server file to create a Server-socket for multiple clients to join the chat.   
## Step-2  
All the clients can then join through same socket.  

__This is more like a Whatsapp Group in CLI.__
